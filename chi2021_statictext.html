<H2> T1: How to Review a Work of Art  (essay) </H2>
<br>
A lot of people outside the art world consider art writing a useful way to communicate a work of art or particular show to a group of readers who may or may not have a chance to see the art in person. I once considered myself such a person, who casually browsed the museum reviews in New York or Berlin or Paris. But once I started writing about art--that is, attending museums and galleries nearby with a pen in hand--I came to understand there's a hidden language in art writing that must be experienced to be understood. Words come to mind: contrast, saturation, juxtapose, ethereal, craft, technique. But these are words for the page and are distinct from the language I discovered when I first began writing about art.
 <br><br>
First, you must find your gallery. Small galleries are good, because the owner is usually around, sitting behind a cluttered desk with an old lazy dog at his feet. Or the owner is next door, having a cup of coffee, and will be back to open the gallery soon. Stand around outside for a minute talking on the phone, pacing in front of the door. If you do this with sunglasses on and a notebook propped open on your hip, all the better. Make sure the owner of the gallery--or better yet: the artist--sees you doing this. This is part of your performance, and it will come in handy later in the process. Hang up the phone and close the notebook. Tuck it away in your bag. A good art reviewer does not walk through the gallery doors with an open notebook, as this is too transparent. Smile at the owner/artist/anyone else who may be in the gallery and walk around. Look at every object. Every painting has value. Every sculpture should be considered from all sides possible. Every piece of music heard. Furrow your brow. 
 <br><br>
When you are approached by the owner or the artist or other authority figure who happens to be hanging around the gallery, introduce yourself. Be nice. Tell them who you are, but not what you're doing in the gallery. Don't make it seem like you're there to buy a piece of art--you don't have that kind of money--but also don't tell them about the review you are writing. In the best case scenario, you will be on assignment for your local paper. You have a deadline to meet and a thousand words to crank out about what's hot and fresh in the scene. Don't say this. The gallery owner is a friendly if sometimes pushy individual, but will kindly step out of your way if you express the desire to simply enjoy the art in the room. Let them go back to their desk before you resume your assessment.
 <br><br>
When they sit down in the chair, whip out your notebook and scribble furiously. This will shock the owner, but they will quickly realize it is more embarrassing to leap out of their chair and return to you than it is to sit and quietly pretend like nothing happened. Write as fast as you can about the art. Write about the size: this bronze lion is the size of a fist. Write about the color: its mane is painted purple. Write about the placement in space: it is perched on a pedestal, yet the painting behind the piece acts as a kind of implied backdrop. Write about the relationship: the small bronze lion with a rich purple mane seems to emerge from the destroyed landscape painted in luxurious oils that compose "Wasteland." Do this for each piece in the show, but spend the most time on the thesis piece. A thesis piece is the work of art in any show that behaves like a summation and synthesis of all the ideas in the gallery. This is your nut graf. Watch the owner sweat. 
<br><br>
When you are finished, close the notebook and spend a few minutes enjoying the art without thinking about anything. Don't think about history. Don't think about subtext. Don't think about the sculptor you slept with in college who kept a book of Bernini under his bed. Thank the gallery owner and leave. Once home, sit on the couch you found on the curb with your laptop open on your lap and type all your notes as you have them written down. Soon, during this process, your own masterpiece will emerge.

<br>
The first thing to know about trail riding is that the occasion is important. If you work at a touristy trail barn like I have, there are three main types of rides: dates, "Grandma had a horse as a kid and is taking us out for a treat," and "The person I'm dating also has kids, and this is a good opportunity to get us all together." 
<br><br>
If it is the first one, see entry for "Macho Guy." 
<br><br>
If it is the second one, prepare for Grandma to not remember how many muscle groups are involved in horseback riding. She will need some extra help, and she will be salty about it. Prepare for her to be frustrated with the children, who will definitely whine and who will definitely start screaming when a horse inevitably shits. 
<br><br>
If it is the third occasion, prepare for the children to awkwardly call Mom's new boyfriend by his first name. The children of both families will be weirdly competitive with each other and will refuse to use each other's names, perhaps because they have forgotten and at this point it's too late to ask.
<br><br>
There are several kinds of people who go on trail rides besides grandmothers, whining children, and parents just trying their best. Stick around a trail barn for a few days, and you will find people like... 

 
<br><br>
Person Who Is Extremely Vocal and Theatrical About Their Fears 
<br><br>
You must put them on the chillest horse you've got, one that won't mind it when they start screaming, and who won't try to pull any punches, because this person is going to be useless. They will not try at all--their passions lie in screaming and perhaps taking selfies. You must put them right behind you in line because they have no interest in controlling the horse, and, contrary to instinct, you want that ticking time bomb close to you. These people, oddly enough, are the most entertaining and hilarious people. Their friends and family members will rag on them and they will take it in stride. You will hear some top-notch ribbing and gain appreciation for it as an art form.
<br><br>
 

Macho Guy
<br><br>
Macho Guys come in two subspecies: "terrified but will never admit it" and "lacks a healthy amount of terror considering that there, you know, there's some danger involved in this whole horseback riding thing." Both species can be treated the same. You must put them on a gelding who walks at a reasonable speed and tell them, "This is [horse name here]. This right here is the boss horse. You gotta watch out for him, because he's the boss." This will bring them reassurance and affirmation. If they are on a date or their partner is present, they will begin to give advice to them, and this advice will usually be wrong. It is very important that you never correct them, because if they are happy at the end of a ride, they will make a big show of slowly pulling out their billfold and peeling off a twenty. 
<br><br>
 

If you read this guide and come away with anything, remember this one fact: they can smell fear. Once, before a trail ride, a woman with Crossfit arms and a push-up bra walked right up to me, put her finger in my face, and bellowed, "If I fall off this horse, I'm going to cut you." 
<br><br>
You must stay calm in these situations. You will smile and say, "You won't fall off."
<br><br>
"I. Will. Cut. You," she will say. 
<br><br>
"Nah, it'll be great. I've got just the horse for you. This is Walter. He's one of my favorites."
<br><br>
 You will show no fear even when, twenty minutes later, she tells you she loves you, then tells you she has the power to read minds, tells you she is certified in reiki and could give the horses a massage, maybe, if your boss lets her. She will extend her stay at the resort just to go on more rides with you, and she will sign her daughter up for summer camp, and she will tag along every single day. But, most importantly, she will tip well.

 <H2> T3: Rising from the bed</h2>
 
 The man woke like every other day of his life. At seven am, he rolled out of bed, making sure to silence the alarm so as not to wake up his girlfriend. He trudged to the bathroom and let his eyes adjust to the bright lights as he brushed his teeth. He allowed himself to stare at his reflection during the two minute duration that his electric toothbrush took. The wrinkles under his eyes had grown, despite the extra hour of sleep he added to his night schedule. He was getting older and his face was starting to show it. He could count on one hand the things he felt lucky to have and that troubled him. At his age, he should have more to be proud of, more to hold in hands and claim, mine. He looked over his shoulder at his girlfriend sleeping and asked himself for the hundredth time this month if he loved her. He still wasn't sure. They'd been dating for a little over a year and he hadn't wanted to rush into anything, despite his age. If he was being honest with himself, he didn't care much about how he felt about her or other things lately. He'd gotten to the point in his life when everything seemed to plateau. Making his way to his closet, he got dressed and fixed the pocket of his pants. When he heard the crinkle of paper, he assumed it to be an old receipt but looked for a brief moment anyway. As he unfurled the note, he felt the color drain from his face. He hadn't seen this note in seven years, two weeks, and three days (if he wanted to be exact). He read it over and over again, letting his mouth whisper the words he had tried hard to forget. Stuffing it back into his pocket, he walked silently down the stairs and into the kitchen. He had forgotten what the loop of the "g" in her name had looked like, forgotten how it matched her wide smile when he cracked a joke. Pouring cereal into a bowl, he thought about the jokes he'd work on in his cubicle at work in the hopes of impressing her when they both went to the cafeteria salad bar. Wednesdays had always been his least favorite days until they had run into each other waiting for the cherry tomatoes to be refilled. He began eating the cereal dry, not bothering to fill the bowl with milk. As the dry cereal crunched in his mouth, he pictured her with her head thrown back laughing, the sun in her blonde hair. She was hard to forget. He pulled the note from his pants and reread the message once more before dumping the rest of the cereal down the garbage disposal. 
 
 <H2> T4: Jewel Case </h2>
 
 The jewel case first bites her when she crawls under her bed to clean. Her arms sweep the ground like she is making a trash snow angel out of wrappers and worn pairs of socks and dust bunnies, sweeping them into a more manageable area. This is what she used to do as a child, and it's an indulgence she continues. The messy kid grew into a messy adult. An ex-boyfriend once said that she leaves a trail of breadcrumbs wherever she goes: hair ties, lipstick-stained coffee cups, receipts. She expected all of those things to be under the bed, but she did not expect to be bitten by a jewel case. 
As she swings her arm out, she feels a stinging and a breaking of skin as the case snaps at her.
<br><br>"Fuck!" she says and puts her hand to her mouth. The jewel case has bitten her in the fleshy part between pointer finger and thumb. She sucks the blood and feels with her tongue the paper-thin flap of skin that has sliced loose. 
<br><br>A few feet in front of her, in the dim light of under-the-bed, the jewel case flexes the sharp plastic of its cover, its hinge squeaking with menace. She knows which CD this is by the Sharpie scrawled on the cover--she knows whose handwriting.
<br><br>When she returns with a broom to flush it out, her cat, Lionel, sits atop his cat tree and watches with passive amusement, even when she pulls the broom away from the bed with the case clamped on to the bristles like a crab. She holds it close to get a better look, and it rattles, the CD clattering against its casing. She sees a speck of her blood in the paper lining of the case, blurring out one of the track listings. The tracks are written in careful, sparking gel pen. 
<br><br>The jewel case is broken, and a small shard of plastic hangs down like a tooth. It snaps at her. She deposits the case into the trash and ties up the bag. She wonders what other objects in her apartment will bite at her--surely there's a lot here that holds a grudge. 
<br><br>But when it's later, and it's darker, she stands on tiptoe to bring down the ancient CD player from its place in her closet shelf. She fishes through the box of gardening supplies an old roommate left behind, and she dons a pair of coarse gloves.
<br><br>Standing in her kitchen, she carefully unties the bag and handles the case. She tries to pry open its jaws to pluck out the CD like a tooth with pliers, but it fights her, flipping and shaking. Lionel hides. The case will not allow her to pull its glittering treasure. She fights the case more and more until the liner notes are ripped and the plastic case is full of fissures and the top third of the CD has snapped off, the Sharpied words disconnected. There is a scattering of plastic on the ground, sharp enough that when she leaves to throw herself on her bed, a piece cuts her foot.
